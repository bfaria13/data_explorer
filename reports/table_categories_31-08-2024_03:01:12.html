THIS WORK OF HIM IS OF COURSE A MUST FOR PHILOSOPHERS, PHILOLOGISTS, SCIENTISTS AND ... for those who want to know more about the phenomenon of irony. AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, VERY WARMLY AND STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.NOTE: This work was originally (thus correctly) named: \"The Concept of Irony with CONTINUAL References to Socrates\" and was written in Danish, instead of Latin., I have used this book extensively to teach classes, write papers, and debate issues. The bibliography is as valuable as the book. The reason Ian Taylor is able to cover such a wide range of subjects, in such depth, is the list of hundreds of qualified proffessionals, whose works he cites. I have yet to find a case of him embellishing the facts in the original documents to make his point.Unfortunately this is a common practice on both sides of the debate, but I have gone to many of the documents that he has cited and have invariably found him to err on the side of caution. There are many great books available on the subject, but if you can only fit two books about The Creation onto your shelf, make them the Bible and IN THE MINDS OF MEN., Used in a class I took on origins, this book is an excellent foundational book to present the creationist side of the evolution-creation debate. It outlines the history of thought relating to evolution starting before Darwin and continuing to present day with speculation on future implications. Intertwined with the history of evolution is a history of ideas which contridict evolution, and various scientific facts and discoveries along those lines. Some generally little known facts about deceptions and misrepresentations by various early evolutionists, and shifts in evolutionary thought since Darwin's time are also mentioned. Many of the typical evolutionary arguments are discussed in detail, including the origin and problem of the arguments.The book itself is very well organized, with a detailed table of contents which includes chapter titles and subheadings. Subheadings are in italics in the text, and chapter headings appear at the top of the right hand pages. Notes and a bibliography appear at the end, as well as a detailed index. Illustrations and poitraits appear throughout the book. I have found the organization of the book handy for looking up facts I have wanted to refresh my memory on.This book is well written and well organized. I highly recommend it for both evolutionists and creationists, as it will provide good reference material for those in either camp of the evolution-creation debate. Even those who find they disagree with the author's premise will find many points to ponder., This was truly a delight to read. It was Insightful and well reasoned throughout. An excellent creationist apologetic that asks the right questions about history and humanity thereby setting the right course for the objective viewing of the subjects involved. I really enjoyed the depth and quantity of insightful information the author used to draw out his conclusions. He was addressing questions that not everyone would think to ask. Also, it had the feel of a historical expose with its bits and pieces so tightly knit together into a singular focus, defining the issue and arriving at the Truth., This book has a great breadth and depth of information.On the one hand it is fascinating to read the historical perspective on the Creation/evolution debate. On the other hand it goes into sufficient scientific detail on issues such as the age of the earth to give a layman's understanding of the issues.It is an unfortunate fact that the current scientific evolutionary bias means that much evidence is ignored or belittled. Though creationist in tone, this book seemed to me to present the facts in an open and unbiased way.Equiped with such knowledge, one is able to recognise the bias and shallowness of certain information from some pro-evolution sources, such as the talk.origins faq. (I actually looked at both sources for information about a particular dating method. Suffice to say that I won't return to the faq when looking for full and unbiased information.)I anticipate that I will be using this book as an important reference book in the years to come., This book is great for writing class papers on evidence supporting Creation and the weaknesses of evolutionism. It also contains several chapters on the philosophy of creationism and evolutionism, both for science and non-science majors. It could be smaller, but it is well organized, with a good bibliography for further research. Don't send your kids to college with out this book, Indeed, this book is the most valuable resource available that presents an historical interpretation of the philosophy that underlies evolutionary teaching. An absolute gem of a work., In the Minds of Men exposes the folly of &quot;modern science&quot; and the hoaxes that have been sold to the American public via National Geographic, PBS, and the public schools. This should be required reading for college freshmen., The rhetoric of the evolutionists can sometimes cause one to doubt his faith. Anyone who is experiencing this should read this book, and all doubts will be removed. Be sure to give a copy to your atheist and agnostic friends as well., This book explores the history of society, starting with the early Egyptians and ending with modern times. The main focus is on the beliefs and doctrines that societies have followed throughout history. And how the beliefs and doctrines of society have shifted with every few generations. Most of these shifts are a direct result of education systems of the time. If you want to reform a society you start with the elite graduate students. When you have a handful of followers your reforms can then be spread easily to the young children in the early stages of the educational system. And thus educate society with your beliefs and doctrines. \"...Educational success is the result of regurgitating opinions and statements that conform to the doctrines of the system.\" Every time there has been a shift in the beliefs and doctrines of the system there have been new theories proposed that challenge the old theories. These new theories have typically been proposed by respected men with a highly educated background, many were highly respected members of the scientific community of their day.Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744 - 1829) proposed a theory that is known as Lamarckism today. It states that traits acquired by the present generation are passed on immediately to the following generation. Lamarckism would seem to explain why the giraffe has a long neck and why birds that live around water have webbed feet. A creature's size would be dependant on the size of its environment. Another idea based on this theory was that a man exercised his brain, his cranial capacity and the mass of his brain would increase. In a few cases this would be proven correct, but in the cases of some of the brilliant minds of science brain mass and cranial capacity have been far below what the expected value was. The classic experiment conducted by August Weismann with white mice. Weismann cut the tails off of nine hundred one white mice in five sequential generations. Each generation was born with a perfectly normal tail. If Lamarck's theory were correct then it would be a very short time before all interbreeding within a population would produce a species that was virtually identical in skin color, hair color, height, etc. If this were true we wouldn't have a problem with racism.Georges Cuvier (1769 - 1832) is the founding father of the science of paleontology and the cornerstone for scientific development to the French. Cuvier's work ethic and his expertise in a vast array of fields made him and his theories overly respected by the French. As a result Cuvier's theory of creation withstood the theory of evolution, in France, for most of the nineteenth century. The accepted opinion of his day was that fossil remains were a direct result of the Genesis flood. But further examination of the fossil records showed that some species would appear to become extinct and then reemerge in later layers. Cuvier's interpretation of this was that there had to have a series of catastrophes rather than just one as the Bible suggests. This began to cause the faith of some to waiver.This was the first theory to propose that the earth was much older than six thousand years. It stated that there had been a series of great catastrophes each wiping out all but the remote corners of the earth, this way life would still be preserved and the earth repopulated. The last of these great catastrophes being the Genesis flood. This theory still supported special creation, but questioned the Biblical time frame of history.Charles Lyell (1797 - 1875) never openly criticized the church or the theological convictions of his day. But his interpretation of geological evidence raised a question of doubt on the Biblical account of the Genesis flood. Lyell's theory is know as Uniformitarianism. There are four basic components to this theory. The first, is that all of nature's laws are constant. Along with this is the assumption that God has never violated nature's laws. Second, the earth's geological features were caused by the same processes of nature that we see today, this would exclude the possibility of large scale catastrophes. Lyell's third assumption was that all geological changes are slow, gradual, and steady. This again leaves no room for large scale catastrophes. And the fourth, proposed that a species could gradually evolve from one to another species. He suggested that the fossil record represented a \"grand cycle,\" this would allow a species to become extinct and then later revolve. This theory would require that the earth be millions of years old, which for some is much easier to believe. Modern geological interpretation is founded upon Lyell's first two assumptions, the third has been modified, and the fourth has been disregarded and forgotten.Uniformitarianism was seen by many of the church as the thin leading edge of a large wedge that was designed and would be used to undermine the Christian faith. As a result of his publications Lyell took a great amount of criticism from the church. His theories would soften the blows of the church and prepare the minds of the people for Darwin's theories, which would be published a few years later.Although Charles Robert Darwin (1809 - 1882) is given complete credit for the theory of evolution, some accused him of stealing his ideas form one of his contemporaries, Alfred Russel Wallace(1823 - 1913). Wallace and Darwin worked independently on a theory that would support evolution. Wallace seemed to have had perpetually bad luck throughout his career and this time his luck would only get worse. After twenty years of study on the subject of natural selection Darwin published his first edition of The Origin Of The Species in 1859.However Darwin's moment of truth was on June 30, 1860 at the Oxford meeting of The British Association For The Advancement Of Science. Darwin's first edition of The Origin Of The Species was cleverly placed in the hands of those that were sympathetic to the cause both in the church and in offices of the state. The public had been promised access to this, the second edition. By this time Darwin's health was poor and it prevented him attending this meeting. So Darwin appointed one of his contemporaries to speak for him, Thomas Huxley. Huxley proved to have been an excellent choice, he would speak on Darwin's behalf many times yet to come. His main motivation for promoting the theory of evolution was his hatred toward the clergy because of the fact that at that time the clergy had a much higher status than a scientist could ever hope of attaining. Huxley was willing to overlook the fact that he disagreed with Darwin on a few points regarding the theory of evolution for the chance to battle with the church in a public arena.Darwin's theory of evolution states that life began by spontaneously generation. That is to say that life randomly generated itself from nonliving matter. And these initial life forms were continuously evolving into more complex life forms, each generation passing on its developments to the next generation. This sounds very similar to Lamarckism, although Darwin denounced it openly and it is generally considered to be a false theory, it is still with us even today.By 1900 Darwin's theory of natural selection was found to be lacking, mainly because there has been no evidence that one species can become another by the accumulating minute variations. Breeding experiments have shown time after time that the species barrier cannot be crossed permanently. This in mind there is no actual proof for the theory of evolution. That is to say the evolution process has never been duplicated in a laboratory or even witnessed in the real world. And if there is no scientific proof for the theory of evolution, then it a belief system accepted on faith, faith based upon alleged scientific facts. These alleged facts are based upon data skewed to fit precreated theories. You might say that sounds a lot like special creation. Special creation requires faith that God created everything man will ever encounter on earth and throughout the universe. The difference is that facts have been twisted to fit the theory of evolution. Rather than first collecting all of the facts, examining them closely, and then after much contemplation deriving a theory from the evidence presented. Many of these discoveries leave holes that evolution cannot explain, whereas a large scale catastrophe such as the Genesis flood could explain. When science encounters two opposing theories that try to explain an event that cannot be explained by the current established theories then the simpler theory is generally accepted, until it can be proven wrong.Since Darwin's Origin (1859) there has been a consistent trend to interpret all natural phenomena in such a way that it appears to provide supporting evidence to the theory of evolution. Some of these interpretations have been based on faulty observation, some on faulty reasoning, and still some on blatant fraud. At times when theories have been discredited within the scientific community, they have been maintained as fact for the general public. To abandon these discredited theories without replacement could put evolutionists in a very humbling position, they would be at risk of having to accept the account of creation. One of the major reasons that evolution is accepted is that people have a hard time accepting something they cannot explain, the miraculous. Miracles instill at least two great fears in people, the first, the fear of God arbitrarily interfering with the affairs of man, and second, the fear of accountability after death.History has shown that man has tried to create a theory to explain away any need for there to be a God. Yet there are still some, even in the respected scientific community, that still acknowledge that there is a God and that the earth and all of its inhabitants were created by this God. They still believe in special creation despite all of this allegedly obvious evidence that supports the theory of evolution. As one writer put it: \"God made man upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes.\"Humanism is basically recognizes the value of the individual and seeks to better the human condition. Secular humanism is the predominant world view today. It views mankind as an integral part of nature and denies any idea of a human soul. Humanistic values are set by whatever has value for man. Morals and ethics become dependent upon situations and the existence of God is denied. To sum up Humanism is to say that man is supreme above all things and that he must create his own life. With this in mind natural man replaces God and becomes the master of his own destiny.Humanistic views deny the existence of a supreme God and all forms of Judeo-Christian religion. Since there is no God the Judeo-Christian principals that form the basis for our legal system could not have been God given. Therefore these laws can be changed to fit whatever any situation without the fear of divine retribution. This type of practice is the root of situation ethics. Humanists say that the reason that man appears to be bad is because, these \"God given\" laws have been imposed on mankind throughout history.The final objective of humanists is to implement a one world government, a new world order, with the elite humanists in control. One of the key elements in the concept of a one world government is the \"unification in the things of the mind.\" Humanistic views and principals have already been established so the next step is to introduce them into the school systems. And the elementary grades are where the minds of children will be the most receptive. Thus making \"maximum progress in minimum time.\" Humanists have seen to it that all Judeo-Christian religious values have been removed form the public school system, and have replaced them with the religious views and principals of humanism. This is a prime example of situation ethics. Preying upon the separation of church and state clause in or country's constitution.The only way church and state can truly be separated is if all forms of religion are introduced through the school system. If all forms of monotheistic religion are removed from the school system, there will still be atheism. In short all of the facts and theories should be presented objectively, and then let people chose for themselves which is the most believable.The author notes the reason for this book is to present facts andinformation to ordinary people. Not information that has been filteredby the humanists, but information that is presented in a objectiveformat. The book is very well documented, with twenty six pages offootnotes and nineteen pages references used by the author as a sourceof data for this book.Google - UN Agenda 21, This book is a must for anyone who wants to think seriously about the issue of origins. It comes with numberous illustrations. Taylor covers the historical and scientific issues very well and delves into the social consequences of darwinism. It may seem expensive, but it's well worth it., The book was a favorite of mine in 1987, the 2 edition. And while recycling books under my kitchen floor storage, I came across it once again! Seeing there was now a 6th edition I ordered one for a friends 60th birthday, then ordered another for myself. It is a great read. One point I wish/hope will be made, is how a college class could create a geologic scale of time, and assign the ages as they wish. Then confirm them with the radio-metric styles used to conform the millions or billions of years desired today. It is a matter of matching the isotopes to the chart, which was assigned a century and a half ago..... whows., Finally a book that approaches science scientifically! I hated biology when I was a kid because it always presupposed evolution into every single facet of biological studies. Then when we learned evolution I learned it was just a theory, and a very sketchy theory at best. As a result, science lost a lot of credibility with me. I hated the subject because it was bias, tainted with sketchy presuppositions, and ruthlessly demanding that we all believe it or else.Ian has done a very fair and balanced study of evolution in this book and using true scientific approaches.I finally learned some science, 33 years later than I was supposed too, but hey maybe we can get an education in America after all!, This book is very dense with facts & figures, and concepts that take me some thinking in order to fully grasp. Don't get me wrong, I love it! But I think it will take me some time to finish reading! An excellent resource for understanding the philisophical worldview today., Engrossing, amazing historical analyses. Well written, more book than I imagined. An outstanding job of picking out inconsistencies and omissions from evolutionary science. Taylor raises many questions on the scientific data for evolution without being arrogant.Ian discusses the early philosophical influences and later scientists who paved the way and laid the seed for Darwinian evolution. Is \"evolution the cause of the ills of the world, and the secular humanism that so dominates our culture? Is the church bringing in this thought into their doctrines?He claims Christianity and monotheism actually spur scientific thought. During the dark ages there was a loss of science. We had to rediscover the future. \"How can astute scientists be so easily deceived\", along with deceiving so many? \"Scientists too are subject to the normal human failings.\" \"To think rationally and fairly is a simplistic myth.\" There is a short biography on Darwin. The voyage on the \"Beagle\" helped transform him from creationist to evolutionist. There are many problems with evolution, which Taylor makes clear. \"This will be defined by who sees the pseudo science for what it is.\" Is this the murder of God?Evolution is a theory based on time and chance. The evolution proponents are willing to make discoveries fit this premise. Many are proven false as once truths. Some have still persisted for over a hundred years. Catastrophe can be the only explanation for the fossils. The fossil indexing to geological age is based on circular reasoning, not science. We will see variations in kind (species) but there are limits. The author goes in depth on carbon dating. Some still use radio metric dating. He explains dating is problematic and inconsistent. It is based on a rate of decay that has been constant. We will discover that creation makes more sense.\"Evolutionist need to hold to a uniformatism\", Very revealing, true account of the invisilble, but powerfully damaging 'other side' that we unknowingly call 'they' and 'them' when we are discussing 'what is wrong in government and politic?'.]", 16, "[This book is very dense with facts & figures, and concepts that take me some thinking in order to fully grasp.

Be sure to give a copy to your atheist and agnostic friends as well., Used in a class I took on origins, this book is an excellent foundational book to present the creationist side of the evolution-creation debate. It outlines the history of thought relating to evolution starting before Darwin and continuing to present day with speculation on future implications. Intertwined with the history of evolution is a history of ideas which contridict evolution, and various scientific facts and discoveries along those lines. Some generally little known facts about deceptions and misrepresentations by various early evolutionists, and shifts in evolutionary thought since Darwin's time are also mentioned. Many of the typical evolutionary arguments are discussed in detail, including the origin and problem of the arguments.The book itself is very well organized, with a detailed table of contents which includes chapter titles and subheadings. Subheadings are in italics in the text, and chapter headings appear at the top of the right hand pages. Notes and a bibliography appear at the end, as well as a detailed index. Illustrations and poitraits appear throughout the book. I have found the organization of the book handy for looking up facts I have wanted to refresh my memory on.This book is well written and well organized. I highly recommend it for both evolutionists and creationists, as it will provide good reference material for those in either camp of the evolution-creation debate. Even those who find they disagree with the author's premise will find many points to ponder., Engrossing, amazing historical analyses. Well written, more book than I imagined. An outstanding job of picking out inconsistencies and omissions from evolutionary science. Taylor raises many questions on the scientific data for evolution without being arrogant.Ian discusses the early philosophical influences and later scientists who paved the way and laid the seed for Darwinian evolution. Is \"evolution the cause of the ills of the world, and the secular humanism that so dominates our culture? Is the church bringing in this thought into their doctrines?He claims Christianity and monotheism actually spur scientific thought. During the dark ages there was a loss of science. We had to rediscover the future. \"How can astute scientists be so easily deceived\", along with deceiving so many? \"Scientists too are subject to the normal human failings.\" \"To think rationally and fairly is a simplistic myth.\" There is a short biography on Darwin. The voyage on the \"Beagle\" helped transform him from creationist to evolutionist. There are many problems with evolution, which Taylor makes clear. \"This will be defined by who sees the pseudo science for what it is.\" Is this the murder of God?Evolution is a theory based on time and chance. The evolution proponents are willing to make discoveries fit this premise. Many are proven false as once truths. Some have still persisted for over a hundred years. Catastrophe can be the only explanation for the fossils. The fossil indexing to geological age is based on circular reasoning, not science. We will see variations in kind (species) but there are limits. The author goes in depth on carbon dating. Some still use radio metric dating. He explains dating is problematic and inconsistent. It is based on a rate of decay that has been constant. We will discover that creation makes more sense.\"Evolutionist need to hold to a uniformatism\", In the Minds of Men exposes the folly of &quot;modern science&quot; and the hoaxes that have been sold to the American public via National Geographic, PBS, and the public schools. This should be required reading for college freshmen., The book was a favorite of mine in 1987, the 2 edition. And while recycling books under my kitchen floor storage, I came across it once again! Seeing there was now a 6th edition I ordered one for a friends 60th birthday, then ordered another for myself. It is a great read. One point I wish/hope will be made, is how a college class could create a geologic scale of time, and assign the ages as they wish. Then confirm them with the radio-metric styles used to conform the millions or billions of years desired today. It is a matter of matching the isotopes to the chart, which was assigned a century and a half ago..... whows., Finally a book that approaches science scientifically! I hated biology when I was a kid because it always presupposed evolution into every single facet of biological studies. Then when we learned evolution I learned it was just a theory, and a very sketchy theory at best. As a result, science lost a lot of credibility with me. I hated the subject because it was bias, tainted with sketchy presuppositions, and ruthlessly demanding that we all believe it or else.Ian has done a very fair and balanced study of evolution in this book and using true scientific approaches.I finally learned some science, 33 years later than I was supposed too, but hey maybe we can get an education in America after all!, I have used this book extensively to teach classes, write papers, and debate issues. The bibliography is as valuable as the book. The reason Ian Taylor is able to cover such a wide range of subjects, in such depth, is the list of hundreds of qualified proffessionals, whose works he cites. I have yet to find a case of him embellishing the facts in the original documents to make his point.Unfortunately this is a common practice on both sides of the debate, but I have gone to many of the documents that he has cited and have invariably found him to err on the side of caution. There are many great books available on the subject, but if you can only fit two books about The Creation onto your shelf, make them the Bible and IN THE MINDS OF MEN., Indeed, this book is the most valuable resource available that presents an historical interpretation of the philosophy that underlies evolutionary teaching. An absolute gem of a work., Very revealing, true account of the invisilble, but powerfully damaging 'other side' that we unknowingly call 'they' and 'them' when we are discussing 'what is wrong in government and politic?'., This was truly a delight to read. It was Insightful and well reasoned throughout. An excellent creationist apologetic that asks the right questions about history and humanity thereby setting the right course for the objective viewing of the subjects involved. I really enjoyed the depth and quantity of insightful information the author used to draw out his conclusions. He was addressing questions that not everyone would think to ask. Also, it had the feel of a historical expose with its bits and pieces so tightly knit together into a singular focus, defining the issue and arriving at the Truth., This book has a great breadth and depth of information.On the one hand it is fascinating to read the historical perspective on the Creation/evolution debate. On the other hand it goes into sufficient scientific detail on issues such as the age of the earth to give a layman's understanding of the issues.It is an unfortunate fact that the current scientific evolutionary bias means that much evidence is ignored or belittled. Though creationist in tone, this book seemed to me to present the facts in an open and unbiased way.Equiped with such knowledge, one is able to recognise the bias and shallowness of certain information from some pro-evolution sources, such as the talk.origins faq. (I actually looked at both sources for information about a particular dating method. Suffice to say that I won't return to the faq when looking for full and unbiased information.)I anticipate that I will be using this book as an important reference book in the years to come., This book explores the history of society, starting with the early Egyptians and ending with modern times. The main focus is on the beliefs and doctrines that societies have followed throughout history. And how the beliefs and doctrines of society have shifted with every few generations. Most of these shifts are a direct result of education systems of the time. If you want to reform a society you start with the elite graduate students. When you have a handful of followers your reforms can then be spread easily to the young children in the early stages of the educational system. And thus educate society with your beliefs and doctrines. \"...Educational success is the result of regurgitating opinions and statements that conform to the doctrines of the system.\" Every time there has been a shift in the beliefs and doctrines of the system there have been new theories proposed that challenge the old theories. These new theories have typically been proposed by respected men with a highly educated background, many were highly respected members of the scientific community of their day.Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744 - 1829) proposed a theory that is known as Lamarckism today. It states that traits acquired by the present generation are passed on immediately to the following generation. Lamarckism would seem to explain why the giraffe has a long neck and why birds that live around water have webbed feet. A creature's size would be dependant on the size of its environment. Another idea based on this theory was that a man exercised his brain, his cranial capacity and the mass of his brain would increase. In a few cases this would be proven correct, but in the cases of some of the brilliant minds of science brain mass and cranial capacity have been far below what the expected value was. The classic experiment conducted by August Weismann with white mice. Weismann cut the tails off of nine hundred one white mice in five sequential generations. Each generation was born with a perfectly normal tail. If Lamarck's theory were correct then it would be a very short time before all interbreeding within a population would produce a species that was virtually identical in skin color, hair color, height, etc. If this were true we wouldn't have a problem with racism.Georges Cuvier (1769 - 1832) is the founding father of the science of paleontology and the cornerstone for scientific development to the French. Cuvier's work ethic and his expertise in a vast array of fields made him and his theories overly respected by the French. As a result Cuvier's theory of creation withstood the theory of evolution, in France, for most of the nineteenth century. The accepted opinion of his day was that fossil remains were a direct result of the Genesis flood. But further examination of the fossil records showed that some species would appear to become extinct and then reemerge in later layers. Cuvier's interpretation of this was that there had to have a series of catastrophes rather than just one as the Bible suggests. This began to cause the faith of some to waiver.This was the first theory to propose that the earth was much older than six thousand years. It stated that there had been a series of great catastrophes each wiping out all but the remote corners of the earth, this way life would still be preserved and the earth repopulated. The last of these great catastrophes being the Genesis flood. This theory still supported special creation, but questioned the Biblical time frame of history.Charles Lyell (1797 - 1875) never openly criticized the church or the theological convictions of his day. But his interpretation of geological evidence raised a question of doubt on the Biblical account of the Genesis flood. Lyell's theory is know as Uniformitarianism. There are four basic components to this theory. The first, is that all of nature's laws are constant. Along with this is the assumption that God has never violated nature's laws. Second, the earth's geological features were caused by the same processes of nature that we see today, this would exclude the possibility of large scale catastrophes. Lyell's third assumption was that all geological changes are slow, gradual, and steady. This again leaves no room for large scale catastrophes. And the fourth, proposed that a species could gradually evolve from one to another species. He suggested that the fossil record represented a \"grand cycle,\" this would allow a species to become extinct and then later revolve. This theory would require that the earth be millions of years old, which for some is much easier to believe. Modern geological interpretation is founded upon Lyell's first two assumptions, the third has been modified, and the fourth has been disregarded and forgotten.Uniformitarianism was seen by many of the church as the thin leading edge of a large wedge that was designed and would be used to undermine the Christian faith. As a result of his publications Lyell took a great amount of criticism from the church. His theories would soften the blows of the church and prepare the minds of the people for Darwin's theories, which would be published a few years later.Although Charles Robert Darwin (1809 - 1882) is given complete credit for the theory of evolution, some accused him of stealing his ideas form one of his contemporaries, Alfred Russel Wallace(1823 - 1913). Wallace and Darwin worked independently on a theory that would support evolution. Wallace seemed to have had perpetually bad luck throughout his career and this time his luck would only get worse. After twenty years of study on the subject of natural selection Darwin published his first edition of The Origin Of The Species in 1859.However Darwin's moment of truth was on June 30, 1860 at the Oxford meeting of The British Association For The Advancement Of Science. Darwin's first edition of The Origin Of The Species was cleverly placed in the hands of those that were sympathetic to the cause both in the church and in offices of the state. The public had been promised access to this, the second edition. By this time Darwin's health was poor and it prevented him attending this meeting. So Darwin appointed one of his contemporaries to speak for him, Thomas Huxley. Huxley proved to have been an excellent choice, he would speak on Darwin's behalf many times yet to come. His main motivation for promoting the theory of evolution was his hatred toward the clergy because of the fact that at that time the clergy had a much higher status than a scientist could ever hope of attaining. Huxley was willing to overlook the fact that he disagreed with Darwin on a few points regarding the theory of evolution for the chance to battle with the church in a public arena.Darwin's theory of evolution states that life began by spontaneously generation. That is to say that life randomly generated itself from nonliving matter. And these initial life forms were continuously evolving into more complex life forms, each generation passing on its developments to the next generation. This sounds very similar to Lamarckism, although Darwin denounced it openly and it is generally considered to be a false theory, it is still with us even today.By 1900 Darwin's theory of natural selection was found to be lacking, mainly because there has been no evidence that one species can become another by the accumulating minute variations. Breeding experiments have shown time after time that the species barrier cannot be crossed permanently. This in mind there is no actual proof for the theory of evolution. That is to say the evolution process has never been duplicated in a laboratory or even witnessed in the real world. And if there is no scientific proof for the theory of evolution, then it a belief system accepted on faith, faith based upon alleged scientific facts. These alleged facts are based upon data skewed to fit precreated theories. You might say that sounds a lot like special creation. Special creation requires faith that God created everything man will ever encounter on earth and throughout the universe. The difference is that facts have been twisted to fit the theory of evolution. Rather than first collecting all of the facts, examining them closely, and then after much contemplation deriving a theory from the evidence presented. Many of these discoveries leave holes that evolution cannot explain, whereas a large scale catastrophe such as the Genesis flood could explain. When science encounters two opposing theories that try to explain an event that cannot be explained by the current established theories then the simpler theory is generally accepted, until it can be proven wrong.Since Darwin's Origin (1859) there has been a consistent trend to interpret all natural phenomena in such a way that it appears to provide supporting evidence to the theory of evolution. Some of these interpretations have been based on faulty observation, some on faulty reasoning, and still some on blatant fraud. At times when theories have been discredited within the scientific community, they have been maintained as fact for the general public. To abandon these discredited theories without replacement could put evolutionists in a very humbling position, they would be at risk of having to accept the account of creation. One of the major reasons that evolution is accepted is that people have a hard time accepting something they cannot explain, the miraculous. Miracles instill at least two great fears in people, the first, the fear of God arbitrarily interfering with the affairs of man, and second, the fear of accountability after death.History has shown that man has tried to create a theory to explain away any need for there to be a God. Yet there are still some, even in the respected scientific community, that still acknowledge that there is a God and that the earth and all of its inhabitants were created by this God. They still believe in special creation despite all of this allegedly obvious evidence that supports the theory of evolution. As one writer put it: \"God made man upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes.\"Humanism is basically recognizes the value of the individual and seeks to better the human condition. Secular humanism is the predominant world view today. It views mankind as an integral part of nature and denies any idea of a human soul. Humanistic values are set by whatever has value for man. Morals and ethics become dependent upon situations and the existence of God is denied. To sum up Humanism is to say that man is supreme above all things and that he must create his own life. With this in mind natural man replaces God and becomes the master of his own destiny.Humanistic views deny the existence of a supreme God and all forms of Judeo-Christian religion. Since there is no God the Judeo-Christian principals that form the basis for our legal system could not have been God given. Therefore these laws can be changed to fit whatever any situation without the fear of divine retribution. This type of practice is the root of situation ethics. Humanists say that the reason that man appears to be bad is because, these \"God given\" laws have been imposed on mankind throughout history.The final objective of humanists is to implement a one world government, a new world order, with the elite humanists in control. One of the key elements in the concept of a one world government is the \"unification in the things of the mind.\" Humanistic views and principals have already been established so the next step is to introduce them into the school systems. And the elementary grades are where the minds of children will be the most receptive. Thus making \"maximum progress in minimum time.\" Humanists have seen to it that all Judeo-Christian religious values have been removed form the public school system, and have replaced them with the religious views and principals of humanism. This is a prime example of situation ethics. Preying upon the separation of church and state clause in or country's constitution.The only way church and state can truly be separated is if all forms of religion are introduced through the school system. If all forms of monotheistic religion are removed from the school system, there will still be atheism. In short all of the facts and theories should be presented objectively, and then let people chose for themselves which is the most believable.The author notes the reason for this book is to present facts andinformation to ordinary people.
