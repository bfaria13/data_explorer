This book is very dense with facts & figures, and concepts that take me some thinking in order to fully grasp. Don't get me wrong, I love it! But I think it will take me some time to finish reading! An excellent resource for understanding the philisophical worldview today.

## Analysis for Humanistic psychotherapy. ##:
> Main descriptive text:
Albert Ellis (1913-2007) was an American psychologist who developed Rational Emotive Therapy (RET), a cognitive-behavioral therapy.This book (published in 1973) consists of 16 essays (some based on lectures/speeches Ellis gave); many of them had been previously published in a wide variety of publications.Here are some representative quotations from the book:"The essence of humanism ... is that man is fully acknowledged to be human---that is, limited and fallible---and that in no way whatever is he superhuman or subhuman.""Humanistic psychology, by this rule, becomes the study of the whole individual, by logico-empirical means that are distinctly human, for the purpose of helping him live a happier, more self-actualizing, and more creative existence."Rational-emotive therapy "insists that nonetheless the individual himself can, and usually does, significantly intervene between his environmental input and his emotionalized output, and that therefore he has an enormous amount of potential control over what he feels and what he does.""Rational-emotive therapy owes a great debt to Alfred Adler, so much so that it is reasonable to inquire whether RET could not have developed within the Adlerian framework, becoming something of a revisionist approach in this system.""(T)he therapist had better be primarily true to, and interested in, himself, rather than be masochistically self-sacrificial. He can thereby engage in therapy because he likes to do so, because he enjoys helping others help themselves."RET "begins with a premise that for the individual to achieve a fundamental change in his personality structure, he must significantly modify some of his deep-seated and long-standing cognitions and beliefs."
